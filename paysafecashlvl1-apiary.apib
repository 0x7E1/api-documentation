# Paysafecash Link or QR code / Manual payment processing (MSC)

Paysafecash offers the possibility for Business Partners to start processing payments with minimal or no technical integration.

Business Partners can use a light version of the integration, as described in this documentation, and step-by-step extend it to support heavier usage and automated processing of goods and services.

## Integration prerequisites

The Business Partner is provided access to the Merchant Service Center. When using the MSC, the Business Partner complies with the provisions of the user manual for the MSC (downloadable from https://www.paysafecash.com/business/downloads).
<br><br>
Paysafecash must be implemented accordingly to the interface guidelines MSC (downloadable from https://www.paysafecash.com/business/downloads) and the instructions in this technical integration document.

## Transaction Flow

![transaction_flow](https://www.paysafecash.com/fileadmin/Paysafecash/Dokumente/B2B/transaction_flow.PNG "Paysafecash Payment Flow")

A Paysafecash Transaction is processed as follows:

+ The Business Partner displays the payment hyperlink or QR-Code to the customer, using the correct Merchant ID and amount, as specified in the next section.

+ The customer initiates the payment by clicking the hyperlink or by scanning the QR-code.

+ The customer verifies that the payment details (including, but not limited to: payee, amount and payment reference) are correct and confirms the transaction. 

+ The Paysafecash payment is created on the behalf of the Business Partner according to the payment details in the confirmation page and the customer is redirected to the barcode panel.

+ The barcode is displayed to the customer and it will only be valid for this specific transaction. The barcode can be viewed in various ways (e.g. online, Paysafecash app, download, e-mail, SMS or iOS / Android passbook file). A predefined time frame ("Transaction Timeout‚Äù) will be available to the customer to pay the transaction amount at a Point of Sale. The duration of this time is by default 72 hours, unless specified otherwise by the Business Partner.

+ To complete the Paysafecash payment, the customer must head to a Point of Sale, have it scanned and pay the transaction amount. If the customer does not pay within the Transaction Timeout, the Paysafecash Transaction expires. If the payment is successful, the customer receives a receipt confirming the payment.

+ The Paysafecash payment is captured on behalf of the Business Partner.
In the rare occasion that the Paysafecash payment system is down due to an outage or any other technical circumstance, the capture of the payment will be delayed but it will be executed.

+ A successful payment notification email is sent to the Business Partner. To prevent fraudulent activities, the notification does not include the payment details.

+ Upon receiving the notification, the Business Partner must log into the Merchant Service Center within 24 hours, verify the payment and deliver the product.

**Important:** Captured payments are irreversible. The Business Partner cannot cancel the Paysafecash payment at any time during the transaction process.

![confirmation_page](https://www.paysafecash.com/fileadmin/Paysafecash/Dokumente/B2B/pcash_link_qr_payment_completion.jpg "Payment Confirmation page")

To avoid payments credited to an account they were not intended for, or unallocated payments, the **Merchant ID (mid)**, the **amount** and **reference** should always be provided by the Busines Partner in the payment link:

Example (Test System): *https://test.paysafecash.com/pay/?mid=1090001964&amount=10.99&reference=0-1-4578545*

# Group All Paysafecash hyperlink parameters
|Parameter                  |Description    |
|---                        |---                                                                 |
|`mid/rc`  (mandatory)      |The Merchant ID and/or Sub-merchant ID provided for the allocation of the payment.    |
|`amount` (optional)        |The payment amount. It can be provided as a parameter or filled by the customer in the confirmation page.  |
|`validUntil` (otpional)    |The expiration time of the transaction (Unix timestamp in milliseconds). The value provided in this parameter overrides the Merchant ID setting in the system. If this parameter it's not provided, the setting will be resolved from the Merchant ID (72 hours by default). |

The Merchant should use any libraries or online tool to create the QR-code, using the payment link as source.

Please make sure to display the QR-code in a way that it can be easily read by any smartphone or QR-code reader - good contrast between the background and the bar color and size depending on the targeted scan distance.

1. When a **paymentReference** is provided, but not the product:

    *paymentReference*_currentTimeInUnixTimestamp

    Ex: *123541256_1531845072396*
<br><br>

2. When a **paymentReference** and the **product** are provided:

    *paymentReference*_currentTimeInUnixTimestamp_*product*

    Ex: *123541256_1531845072396_MDIRECTLOAD*
        *123541256_1531845072396_PAYSAFECARD*
<br><br> 

3. When the **Merchant ID (MID)** is provided, but not a paymentReference:

    *lifnr*_currentTimeInUnixTimestamp
    
    Ex: *1000000007_1531845072396*
<br><br>

4. When the **Merchant ID (MID)** and a **Sub Merchant Id(RC)** are provided, but not a paymentReference:

    *lifnr*_*rc*_currentTimeInUnixTimestamp
    
    Ex: *1000000007_METIN2_1531845072396*
    <br><br>
    Including also the **product**:
    
    *lifnr*_*rc*_currentTimeInUnixTimestamp_*product*
    
    Ex: *1000000007_RC1_1531845072396_MDIRECTLOAD*
    *1000000007_RC2_1531845072396_PAYSAFECARD*

    *typeOfPayment_mid_paymentReference_shortRandomlyGeneratedString_currency*
